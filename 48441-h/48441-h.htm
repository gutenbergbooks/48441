<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>Since we talk in phrases as well as in words
every home needs a phrase book as well as a
dictionary.</p>

<p>This book has been prepared to meet that need,
and contains a dictionary of six thousand choice
phrases arranged synonymously for general use;
many polite expressions, phrases of charm and
courtesy, for use in letter writing; one hundred
sample social letters, including instruction concerning
the method of their preparation by the
use of the dictionary of phrases; a guide to choice
phrases for social letter writing; and finally, a
handy index, very helpful, even though the phrases
have been arranged in dictionary form.</p>

<p>I have made an effort to emphasize phrases
of commendation, optimism, and courtesy. Also
many for use in letter writing——especially phrases
suitable for letters of condolence. There is perhaps
no more difficult letter to write than one
of condolence, hence a considerable number
under this designation in order to assist in this
necessary and yet most blessed task.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this book is that it
may serve as a synonymous phrase dictionary,
yet I have so planned it that it can also be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
as a social letter writer. The dictionary of
phrases is to be used in letter writing in connection
with the sample letters. In case the
sample letters are not desirable, the instructions
and guide, upon pp. <a href="#Page_275">275-81</a> will show how to use
the book when one desires to write his own social
letters.</p>

<p>Some of the social letters were written by using
the phrases in the dictionary section of the book;
others were suggested by the perusal of the same.</p>

<p>The very fact that one keeps his eyes open for
new expressions tends to make him more careful
of his own phraseology, and to encourage the
constant improvement of his own style either by
the addition of old phrases, new to him, or by the
coining of new ones.</p>

<p>Whenever and wherever I have found in any
volume, magazine, newspaper, or in conversation,
a usable phrase I have made note of it.
This method has given me the material for the
book. As far as possible I have endeavored to
collect phrases which are the common speech of
all, phrases which are not quotations, and are
the property of all.</p>

<p>I am very greatly indebted to all I have heard
and read, especially to the standard authors.</p>

<p>I have included and located a goodly number
of phrases from Shakespeare and the Bible.</p>

<p>None the worse for a spark of decent indignation</p>

<p>The hollow shams and conventionalities of our

<p>The hundred and one enemies of our peace, comfort,

<p>The burning poison in his veins</p>

<p>There is nothing more likely to betray a man

Spirit of God</p>

<p>Over head and ears in debt and drink</p>

<p>The peril of riches</p>

<p>A coronet of shame</p>

<p>The secret beginnings of sin</p>

<p>An eternal arraignment of all who——</p>

<p>Trifling with great spiritual realities</p>

<p>The horror of a bottomless pit</p>

<p>Habits which quietly sap the foundations of life</p>

<p>Words which will shock some dainty soul</p>

<p>A sickening devotion to the pursuit of wealth</p>

<p>The evils of unrighteousness in civic life</p>

<h4>(For General Conversation)</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p>It goes without saying that——</p>

<p>I am obliged to confess that——</p>

<p>It was a happy thought which led me to——</p>

<p>I venture to propose that——</p>

<p>We had great fun when——</p>

<p>I indulge the modest hope that——</p>

<p>It must be very gratifying to you to——</p>

<p>I am deeply persuaded that——</p>

<p>Reverting to another matter——</p>

<p>I ought not omit remarking that——</p>

<p>And so it befell that——</p>

<p>After expatiating on the——</p>

<p>It is a very curious circumstance to see how——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>I frankly confess that——</p>

<p>It is really disconcerting to find that——</p>

<p>I am revealing no secret in saying that——</p>

<p>I must not leave you under misapprehensions so——</p>

<p>I am rather inclined to the opinion that——</p>

<p>I do not find anything in the tenets of my religion
which requires me to——</p>

<p>I have a peculiar tenderness for——</p>

<p>As I am continually saying——</p>

<p>In a very humble way, I——</p>

<p>My impression is that——</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was——</p>

<p>Far be it from me to——</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that——</p>

<p>You will be very much pleased to hear that——</p>

<p>I will venture to express a hope that——</p>

<p>I have but one rule to guide my conduct and that
is——</p>

<p>I have been strongly tempted to——</p>

<p>Besides this there is to be said——</p>

<p>There is but a thousand-to-one chance that——</p>

<p>It is an open secret that——</p>

<p>I have an impression that——</p>

<p>I informed you wrongly when I said that——</p>

<p>If I mistake not, I believe that——</p>

<p>If I may use the expression I think that——</p>

<p>Quite regardless of my remark, you——</p>

<p>I had the inexpressible comfort of knowing that——</p>

<p>He made a touching proof of his regard by——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>I flatter myself that——</p>

<p>Is it not a great mercy to have such a helper</p>

<p>Again and again, I——</p>

<p>Inadvertently, I——</p>

<p>I felt like uttering a mild disclaimer when——</p>

<p>I have little predilection for——</p>

<p>I had the rare satisfaction of——</p>

<p>I was strangely moved when I heard that——</p>

<p>There is a certain distinctive advantage in——</p>

<p>I was amazed to find that——</p>

<p>In my poor judgment, I——</p>

<p>I hold in all seriousness that——</p>

<p>Has the tide of victory set in your favor</p>

<p>By what magic have you found out the secrets
of——</p>

<p>We have plumed ourselves upon our ability to——</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I——</p>

<p>To be candid, I——</p>

<p>It seems a positive calamity that——</p>

<p>Do you seriously imagine that——</p>

<p>No one could be so rash as to assert that——</p>

<p>I am satisfied that——</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that——</p>

<p>I fancy that——</p>

<p>Further than this——</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem——</p>

<p>I dare say that——</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that——</p>

<p>It would ill become me to remark that——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>For instance,——</p>

<p>The redeeming feature of it all is——</p>

<p>Quite by chance, I——</p>

<p>I have been wondering whether——</p>

<p>In all probability we——</p>

<p>It is not likely that——</p>

<p>Luckily I——</p>

<p>It is a singular coincidence that——</p>

<p>I took particular pains to notice whether——</p>

<p>It is with problems such as these that——</p>

<p>How very fortunate it is that——</p>

<p>It is a particular piece of good fortune that he——</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I——</p>

<p>None the less, I——</p>

<p>It can be admitted too that——</p>

<p>Certain it is that——</p>

<p>In some quarters it is believed that——</p>

<p>If that be the case, I——</p>

<p>I confess I look with some alarm at——</p>

<p>I have the great good fortune to have heard that——</p>

<p>I realize afresh that——</p>

<p>The art of arts is——</p>

<p>I flatter myself that——</p>

<p>It is from the heart that I can request that——</p>

<p>I am perfectly convinced that——</p>

<p>The full gravity of the situation is seen in the
fact that——</p>

<p>Regardless of anything I said——</p>

<p>I am painfully conscious that——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>I wasn’t by any means sure I——</p>

<p>It dawned upon him gradually that——</p>

<p>It is seldom that——</p>

<p>We may be quite sure that——</p>

<p>I have repeatedly said that——</p>

<p>It cannot but carry with it instant conviction
that——</p>

<p>By some mischance, I——</p>

<p>Prior to this, we——</p>

<p>I was greatly elated to find that——</p>

<p>I am heartily glad that——</p>

<p>I had a happy thought to-day which I——</p>

<p>I cannot but realize that——</p>

<p>It is scarcely conceivable that——</p>

<p>Frankly, I——</p>

<p>It is intellectually unthinkable that——</p>

<p>On the other hand——</p>

<p>I appreciate most deeply the——</p>

<p>I am devoutly thankful for——</p>

<p>At all events——</p>

<p>I rather apprehend that——</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought that——</p>

<p>It must be owned too, that——</p>

<p>I scarcely feel as if I——</p>

<p>I rather imagine that——</p>

<p>To this day I hardly know whether I——</p>

<p>A very striking proof of the fact is——</p>

<p>I will hazard the observation that——</p>

<p>On the other hand——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>May I give you an instance</p>

<p>It is quite indifferent to me whether I——</p>

<p>He used frequently to observe that——</p>

<p>Now that I am a little seasoned, I——</p>

<p>I have heard him often lament that——</p>

<p>You may guess what luck——</p>

<p>I regret extremely that——</p>

<p>It would have been quite out of the question for
us to——</p>

<p>Recently I came across this——</p>

<p>I was about to inquire what you thought of——</p>

<p>I have the deepest veneration for——</p>

<p>I suppose the inference we are expected to draw
is——</p>

<p>I am confident of one thing that——</p>

<p>My principal motive for acting thus was——</p>

<p>I am fully aware that——</p>

<p>I perceive, moreover, that——</p>

<p>It is surely true that——</p>

<p>I marvel that——</p>

<p>I sometimes fancy that——</p>

<p>I humbly conceive that——</p>

<p>I apprehend that——</p>

<p>Of course, I am perfectly aware that——</p>

<p>I presume that——</p>

<p>There are pretty certain indications that</p>

<p>It often amazes me that——</p>

<p>It seems hardly probable that——</p>

<p>I affirm that——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>I have the consolation to hope that——</p>

<p>It is still permitted us to hope that——</p>

<p>It would be futile to deny that——</p>

<p>It is reasonable to assume that——</p>

<p>There is no prospect that——</p>

<p>In these circumstances it——</p>

<p>I suppose that——</p>

<p>I warrant that——</p>

<p>I confess I am not indifferent to——</p>

<p>I shrink instinctively from——</p>

<p>I confess a less and less relish for——</p>

<p>I am impatient and querulous under——</p>

<p>It is a sort of presumption to expect that——</p>

<p>I cannot imagine to myself——</p>

<p>I have a kindly yearning toward——</p>

<p>I heartily approve of——</p>

<p>I do not advert to——</p>

<p>I have long believed that——</p>

<p>It has long been the fashion to——</p>

<p>I have been falsely assuring everybody that——</p>

<p>One cannot help noticing that——</p>

<p>There are plenty of evidences that——</p>

<p>The difference, I take it, is this——</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is——</p>

<p>If I rightly remember——</p>

<p>It is a just cause for praise that——</p>

<p>It was a happy circumstance for me that——</p>

<p>I wish with all my heart that——</p>

<p>I am grateful to find that——</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that——</p>

<p>My attention has been directed to the——</p>

<p>I have a mental reservation with regard to——</p>

<p>A very affecting circumstance happened yesterday</p>

<p>I have a story worth telling</p>

<p>I had the rare distinction of——</p>

<p>I had a very civil note from——</p>

<p>If I may hazard a conjecture, I should rather
think that——</p>

<p>It was unusual for me to——</p>

<p>We extend our heartfelt sympathy</p>

<p>In your hour of trial</p>

<p>She was such a beautiful character, loved by
every one</p>

<p>In these lonely hours you must not be cast down
for there is help from God</p>

<p>His Word says that they that wait upon Him
shall renew their strength</p>

<p>She was God’s good angel in your home</p>

<p>We must be brave in the face of trying circumstances</p>

<p>Of gracious memory</p>

<p>She bears up with the utmost fortitude</p>

<p>I received the melancholy intelligence last evening
that——</p>

<p>He was the kindest, and most generous of men</p>

<p>The sweet remembrance of the just</p>

<p>A workman that needeth not to be ashamed</p>

<p>If God be for us who can be against us</p>

<p>Of whom the world was not worthy</p>

<p>Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth</p>

<p>Let not your heart be troubled</p>

<p>I know that your heart must be sorely grieved</p>

<p>God shall overcome this King of terrors</p>

<p>It is written, “As thy days so shall thy strength
be”</p>

<p>We expect to see our loved ones in happier,
brighter worlds above</p>

<p>God is able to soothe and sustain the distressed
soul</p>

<p>May God’s love shine more and more in our
hearts until the day breaks and the shadows
flee away</p>

<p>He careth for you</p>

<p>A stronghold in the day of trouble</p>

<p>A covert from the storm</p>

<p>We unite in sending our love and sympathy</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>Our hearts sorrow with you</p>

<p>He is such a very great comfort to us</p>

<p>We are uplifted by the assurance that——</p>

<p>A light which sorrow cannot quench</p>

<p>We must all wait the call of God with a calm
trust</p>

<p>Let me have the comfort of hearing from you</p>

<p>The hand of God has been heavy</p>

<p>His sterling qualities of character will leave an
indelible impress on those with whom he
associated</p>

<p>His good life will live on</p>

<p>Dying in the triumphs of faith</p>

<p>Securely anchored in the never failing promises
of God</p>

<p>A life of good-will, kindliness of spirit, and firm
character</p>

<p>The benediction of his brotherly heart will bless
many who knew him</p>

<p>We must live in the blessed anticipation of the
glory that is to come</p>

<p>Do not fear, for God knows what is in your heart</p>

<p>Your path seems full of thorns</p>

<p>Your weather is bleak, but the storms will cease</p>

<p>Your sky is dark, but the sun shines</p>

<p>May the everlasting arms sustain you in the flood
of sorrow</p>

<p>I know you are in grief and heaviness</p>

<p>We commend you to the mercy and grace of God</p>

<p>The bitterness of affliction</p>

<p>The present floods of sorrow</p>

<p>You will have to cast your anchor in the dark</p>

<p>May your heart be constant</p>

<p>The Lord will surely give you rest from the days
of adversity</p>

<p>I would that you should always have the sweet
experience of the consolations of God</p>

<p>We all have the good-will of Him who dwelt in
the bush</p>

<p>My heart is heavy for you</p>

God, and the sweet presence of Christ to
you and yours</p>

proper temper, and quiet perseverance, and
that these trials may help us to purify our
motives</p>

<p>One of the severest and most trying dispensations
of Providence</p>

all that could possibly be done</p>

been since I first heard of your great loss</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>I have the pleasure to concur with you</p>

<p>I am perfectly of that opinion</p>

<p>That is precisely my view of the case</p>

<p>It is an admirable way of putting it</p>

<p>It is extremely interesting, I can assure you</p>

<p>It fits exactly with my notion</p>

<p>It will be generally acquiesced in</p>

<p>I shall be most happy to grant it</p>

<p>I will with great pleasure</p>

<p>It sounds plausible</p>

<p>I am quite content to leave the judgment of it
to you</p>

<p>I am pretty fully in accord with——</p>

<p>I can see the desirability of such an arrangement</p>

<p>I am sure the happiest results would ensue</p></div>


<h4>(Negative)</h4>

<p>The answer is a plain negative</p>

<p>I am quite unable to say</p>

<p>I should think it very unlikely</p>

<p>What leads you to that conclusion, if I may ask</p>

<p>What an extraordinary observer you are</p>

<p>It is too remote for reminiscence</p>

<p>That is a fascinating field for difference of opinion</p>

<p>It seems that it is a case difficult either of proof
or disproof</p>

<p>There seems to be a very great diversity in our

loss of your dear mother. When one loses her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
mother she feels she has lost her best friend, and
can only wait for time to heal the heartache.
With assurance of love,</p>

<p class="closing2">Very sincerely yours,</p>



<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear</span> ————,</p>

<p>Our hearts sorrow with you. Your ———— was

friends. All the gentle virtues came into full
bloom in ————.</p>

<p>We send our united and sincere condolences,</p>

<p class="closing2">Most faithfully yours,</p>



<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear</span> ————,</p>

<p>I am sincerely sorry to hear of your loss. You,
who have so often comforted others, are now
to be comforted. And what better word can I
send to you than that which Paul writes in the
Second Epistle to the Corinthians: “Blessed be
God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
who comforteth us in all our tribulations that we
may be able to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of
Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
aboundeth by Christ.”</p>

<p>We offer our sincere sympathy in your great
sorrow.</p>

<p class="closing2">Most faithfully yours,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<h4>(On Death of Soldier)</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear</span> ————,</p>

<p>May I express to you my sincere condolence in
your hour of sorrow. I have just learned that
your son gave his life, though not in battle, still in
his and our Country’s cause. We are all proud
of him, and I sincerely hope that you will find
much comfort in the knowledge of the affection
in which he is held.</p>

<p class="closing2">With sincerest sympathy,</p>



<h4>(When Interment is at Home)</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear</span> ————,</p>

<p>We have just been informed that your son’s
body has been lovingly laid to rest at home. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
ever we were proud of our soldier boys it is now.
Every day their sacrifices are more precious to us
as we dwell upon their likeness to the greatest of
all sacrifices which God made for us through his
Son.</p>

<p>May the God of all comfort, comfort you and
yours is our prayer.</p>

<p class="closing2">Sincerely yours,</p>



<h4>(Interment of Soldier)</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear</span> ————,</p>

<p>I am thinking of you to-day in all your sorrow,
yet knowing that you are comforted. Comforted
by the assurance that your son died as a true
soldier, giving his all at its best for you and for
his country; comforted by the fact that you have
him near you again, where you can go occasionally
in sweet reverence and recall precious memories.
Above all you must be comforted by the Redeemer’s
resurrection promise that you shall see
your dear son again.</p>

<p>Please accept my heartfelt sympathy.</p>

<p class="closing2">Your Friend,</p>
